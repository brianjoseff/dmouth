Use this README file to introduce your application and point to useful places in the API for learning more.
Run "rake doc:app" to generate API documentation for your models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.

heroku run rake db:setup

for local development, don't run rake db:reset....use rake db:populate which does the same thing except runs our custom database populating functions as well

 We are using heroku to host the application so to update things on the production server:
 HEROKU CREDENTIALS:
 **put these in env var
 
 
 $ bundle exec rake assets:precompile
 $git add .
 $git commit –m “info message here”
 $git push heroku master
 
 
 heroku run rake db:migrate
 heroku run rak assets:precompile
 

STYLESHEETS:
I am terrible at css, still don't get the basic structure of it,
 so all stylesheets get the job done, but are very "hacky" and ad hoc.
 There are some SASS files, that sort of follow the object-file relationship.
 i.e. there is styling stuff in 'articles.css.scss' that applies only to articles file structure
 styling stuff in application.css are either for global styles or front page stylings 
 'scaffolds.css.scss' also has global stylings
